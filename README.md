## Get Started

* Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [python3.10](https://www.python.org/), and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
* Run `npm i` to set up the development environment
* Run `npm start` to run django development server and react development server at the same time.  

> **_NOTE:_** watchdog is going to run for both django and react so you don't have to reload them after making changes to your code. Press CTRL + C to kill them at the same time.
